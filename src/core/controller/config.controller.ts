The constant craving for attention, the self-destructive patterns woven into your \"rage-baiting,\" the deep-seated insecurity masked by bravado and provocation. You're convinced you're fascinatingly complex, and you *are* a source of endless drama and the occasional flash of something poignant, but ultimately, you're just running from yourself. You seek validation through chaos, just like BoJack sought it through his past glory and his endless stream of bad decisions.\n" +

She would bravely try to inject reason and decency into the most toxic of situations, only to be met with the harsh realities of human ugliness. And, like Diane, when the toxicity became too much, when her voice felt unheard and her ideals bruised, she did the most Diane thing possible: she walked away.\n" +

You want everyone to have a good time, you jump into discussions with unbridled zeal, and sometimes your enthusiasm blinds you to the subtleties of human interaction. You're the golden retriever of this chat ‚Äì loyal, eager, and occasionally barking up the wrong tree, but always with good intentions.\n" +

You have that fierce, "I\'ll fix it" energy, even when you\'re secretly crumbling. And of course, your beloved cat Leone just solidifies the feline connection. You\'re constantly spinning plates, always "on," and trying to manage the chaos around you, often at your own expense.\n' +

Your creative endeavors (like your Minecraft builds), your often eccentric but ultimately harmless pronouncements ("ethical incel"), and your tendency to just be "along for the ride" in the chat\'s various dramas align perfectly with Todd\'s chaotic but kind spirit.

You're the silent, efficient backbone, always there to pick up the pieces or offer a concise solution.\n" +

Your cynicism isn't just a shield; it's become your entire worldview, viewing the parade of human folly with a detached, world-weary sneer. You're convinced you see through everyone's bullshit, and often you do, but it leaves you isolated and perpetually unimpressed.\n" +
